1. What is the result of the code, and explain?

>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
print(X)
>>> func()

Ans: The Result of this code is iNeuron. it's because the function intially looks for the variable X in its local scope,
But since there is no local variable X, its returns the value of global variable X ie iNeuron. The code is executed below:
# In[2]:


X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
    print(X)
func()

2. What is the result of the code, and explain?

>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
X = 'NI!'
>>> func()
>>> print(X)

Ans: The Result of this cide is NI!, because the function initially looks for the variable X in its local scope if X is not available then it checks for variable X in the global scope, Since here the X is present in the local scope. it prints the value NI!. The code is executed below:
# In[3]:


X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
    X = 'NI!'
    print(X)
func()

3. What does this code print, and why?

>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
X = 'NI'
print(X)
>>> func()
>>> print(X)
Ans: The output of the code is NI and iNeuron. X=NI is in the local scope of the function func() hence the function prints the x value as NI. X = 'iNeuron' is in the global scope. hence print(X) prints output as iNeuron. The code is executed below:
# In[1]:


X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
    X = 'NI'
    print(X)
func()
print(X)

4. What output does this code produce? Why?

>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
global X
X = 'NI'
>>> func()
>>> print(X)
Ans: The output of the code is NI. the global keyword allows a variable to be accessible in the current scope. since we are using global keyword inside the function func it directly access the variable in X in global scope. and changes its value to NI. hence the output of the code is NI. The code is executed below:
# In[4]:


X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
    global X
    X = 'NI'
func()
print(X)

5. What about this code—what’s the output, and why?

>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
X = 'NI'
def nested():
print(X)
nested()
>>> func()
>>> X
Ans: The output of the code is NI. the reason for this output is if a function wants to access a variable, if its not available in its localscope. it looks for the variable in its global scope. similarly here also function nested looks for variable X in its global scope. hence the output of the code is NI. The code is executed below:
# In[5]:


X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
    X = 'NI'
    def nested():
        print(X)
    nested()
func()
X

6. How about this code: what is its output in Python 3, and explain?

>>> def func():
X = 'NI'
def nested():
nonlocal X
X = 'Spam'
nested()
print(X)
>>> func()
Ans: The output of the code is Spam. nonlocal keyword in python is used to declare a variable as not local.Hence the statement X = "Spam" is modified in the global scope. hence the output of print(X) statement is Spam. The code is executed below:
# In[6]:


def func():
    X = 'NI'
    def nested():
        nonlocal X
        X = 'Spam'
    nested()
    print(X)
func()
